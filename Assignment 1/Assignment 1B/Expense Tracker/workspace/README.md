We will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `Transaction`: A class to represent a transaction (either income or expense). It will have attributes such as `amount`, `category`, and `date`.

2. `add_transaction()`: A function to add a new transaction.

3. `edit_transaction()`: A function to edit an existing transaction.

4. `delete_transaction()`: A function to delete a transaction.

5. `get_transactions()`: A function to get all transactions.

6. `calculate_totals()`: A function to calculate the total income, total expense, and net balance.

7. `TransactionTest`: A class for unit tests. It will have methods to test the CRUD operations and the `calculate_totals()` function.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
