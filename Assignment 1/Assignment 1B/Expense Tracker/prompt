Create a web-based budget and expense tracker using Python Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the 
frontend. The application should allow users to add, edit, delete, and view both incomes and expenses, categorizing them 
into various types (e.g., Food, Utilities, Salary, etc.).Implement unit tests to validate the CRUD operations for income 
and expense items, as well as the correct calculation of total income, total expense, and net balance.
