I encountered issues with JADBio when attempting to create a model, which led me to opt for the DataRobot ML Platform

## DataRobot -
DataRobot is a machine learning platform and artificial intelligence (AI) company that provides a range of tools and services for automated machine learning (AutoML) and data science.

Here are the steps I took:
1.Uploaded the Avocado Prices Kaggle dataset.

2.Conducted an analysis of both informative and raw features.

3.Selected the target feature.

4.Initiated the modeling process for the dataset.

5.Chose the Elastic-Net Regressor, which yielded the highest score after feature extraction.

6.Utilized the model for making predictions.

7.Tested the model's performance using test data.
